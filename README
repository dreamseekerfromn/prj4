pcb.h - contain structure for the bakery algorithm

DESCRIPTION
simple os simulator to schedule multiple feedback queue.
it has 3 priority. 0 for RR 1,2 for FCFS
all the children will be started w/ priority 1.
if they are blocked by oss, it will move to upper level
if they finished before the given quantum, move to lower level.

-h
will show the purpose of the file "test"

-s [integer]
set maximum number of processes to [integer]

-l [filename]
the output will be [filename]

-t [integer]

Additional Note
1. always kicked out when execute more than 10. (require to optimize)
2. this time, 1 sec is equal to 1000000 nano(10^-7), not 100000000 nano(10^-9).
3. could not finish before midnight (current time is 7:07 AM)
